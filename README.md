Sumaiya's Portfolio as Front End Developer


## Description

This is a portfolio to showcase my skills as a Frontend Developer for potential employers.
Learning:
I found drawing a wireframe of the portfolio in a simple tool excalidraw super useful before starting writing the html from scratch.
It helped me visualise how I wanted to showcase the information before writting code.
