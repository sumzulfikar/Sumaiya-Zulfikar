# Project Objective

Created a personal Developer's portfolio for prospective employers looking to hire Front End Developers.

## Description

This is my portfolio to showcase my skills as a Frontend Developer for organisations looking to build or improve their front-end website and applications.
Feel free to connect with me through the contact me section  of my [portfolio](https://sumzulfikar.github.io/Sumaiya-Zulfikar/) and let us build products that customers love!
Learning:
I found drawing a wireframe of the portfolio in a simple tool excalidraw before coding very helpful.
The wireframe helped me visualise how I wanted to showcase the information before writing any code.
